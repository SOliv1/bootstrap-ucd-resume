        # Mini Project 
     ## UCD resume

My Resume modified - from **Code Institute UCD resume**

In this excercise we begin by opening our workspace and adding git to keep track.

1) Once we did that we proceeded to upload profile image  "Rosie"

2) Then we moved on to get our title and name in place. 
3) Saved the changes and previewed our website by  cmd R or "hard" cmd + shift R
4) We then proceeded to build the structure of our website beginning with the header
   then the footer and adding the logo, three reasons to hire me,
   contact and personal details.
